# Tree Constructor

This is a small tool to construct trees from their traversals. It 
can be used [here](https://mityax.github.io/tree-construction/).

The tool can construct trees if either

 - pre- and inorder traversals or
 - in- and postorder traversals 

are given.

It also does some validity checking to avoid users trapping
into typo-caused mistakes or the like.

Lastly, it reconstructs the third (missing) traversal and displays
it to the user.
